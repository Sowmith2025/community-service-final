# Changelog

This file documents the changes made to the project in an attempt to resolve deployment issues on Render.

## 1. Enable Frontend Serving in `backend/server.js`

*   **File:** `backend/server.js`
*   **Change:** Uncommented the code block that serves the static frontend files in a production environment.
*   **Reason:** The initial problem was a blank white page, which was caused by the backend not serving the frontend files.

```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  const angularDistDir = path.join(__dirname, '../frontend-angular/dist/frontend-angular');
  // ... more code
  app.use(express.static(staticDir));
  app.get('*' , (req, res) => {
    // ... more code
  });
}
```

## 2. Debugging Build Issues on Render

The following changes were made to `frontend-angular/package.json` to resolve the `ng: not found` error during the build process on Render.

### Attempt 1: Use local `ng` executable

*   **File:** `frontend-angular/package.json`
*   **Change:** Modified the `build` script from `"ng build"` to `"node_modules/.bin/ng build"`.
*   **Reason:** To explicitly specify the path to the local Angular CLI executable.

### Attempt 2: Use `npx`

*   **File:** `frontend-angular/package.json`
*   **Change:** Modified the `build` script to `"npx ng build"`.
*   **Reason:** `npx` is the standard way to run locally installed package executables.

### Attempt 3: Add `prebuild` script

*   **File:** `frontend-angular/package.json`
*   **Change:** Added a `"prebuild": "npm install"` script.
*   **Reason:** To ensure that dependencies are installed right before the build script is executed.

### Attempt 4: Use `npm run ng`

*   **File:** `frontend-angular/package.json`
*   **Change:** Modified the `build` script to `"npm run ng -- build"`.
*   **Reason:** To use npm's script runner to execute the `ng` command, as another way to work around the `npx` issue.

### Attempt 5: Use relative path in `ng` script

*   **File:** `frontend-angular/package.json`
*   **Change:** Modified the `ng` script to `"node_modules/.bin/ng"`.
*   **Reason:** A final attempt to use a relative path to the `ng` executable.

## Conclusion

After numerous attempts, the build process on Render continued to fail with `ng: not found` or similar errors. This indicates a problem with the Render build environment itself, rather than with the project's code.

The recommended next step is to try a different deployment platform like Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify, or to contact Render support for assistance.
