## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Key Features Implemented:

1. **Complete CRUD for All Resources**
   - All major resources (Events, Users, Attendance, Registrations) have full CRUD operations

2. **Data Validation**
   - Input validation on all create and update operations
   - Existence checks before updates and deletes
   - Business logic validation (e.g., event capacity checks)

3. **Cascade Deletions**
   - Deleting an event removes associated registrations and attendance records
   - Deleting a user removes their registrations and attendance records
   - Deleting an organizer removes their created events

4. **Query Filtering**
   - Attendance records can be filtered by userId, eventId, and status
   - Registrations can be filtered by userId, eventId, and status
   - Efficient querying with MongoDB

5. **Population and Relations**
   - Events populated with organizer information
   - Registrations populated with user and event details
   - Attendance records populated with user and event information
   - User profiles include registered events and attendance history

6. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling across all endpoints
   - Appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500)
   - Descriptive error messages

## 🚀 Server Configuration

The server is configured in `backend/server.js` with all routes properly registered:

```javascript
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/api/events', eventRoutes);
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
app.use('/api/attendance', attendanceRoutes);
app.use('/api/organizer', organizerRoutes);
app.use('/api/registrations', registrationRoutes);  // NEW
```

## 📊 Database Models

### Event Model
- title, description, date, time, location
- maxVolunteers, category, status
- organizerId (reference to User)

### User Model
- name, email, password (hashed)
- role (student/organizer/admin)
- phone, department
- hoursCompleted (calculated)

### Registration Model
- userId (reference to User)
- eventId (reference to Event)
- status (registered/attended/cancelled)
- registeredAt (timestamp)

### Attendance Model
- userId (reference to User)
- eventId (reference to Event)
- checkInTime, checkOutTime
- hours (calculated)
- status (checked-in/completed)

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- JWT-based authentication implemented
- User registration with password hashing (bcrypt)
- Login with token generation
- Token includes userId, email, and role

---

## 🎨 API Response Format

All endpoints follow consistent response formats:

**Success Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "message": "Success message"
}
```

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Error description",
  "error": "Detailed error message"
}
```

## 📈 Statistics and Calculations

The system automatically calculates:

1. **User Hours**: Total volunteer hours from completed attendance records
2. **Events Attended**: Count of completed attendance records
3. **Registration Counts**: Number of users registered for each event
4. **Event Capacity**: Whether an event is full (registrations >= maxVolunteers)
5. **Leaderboard Rankings**: Users sorted by total volunteer hours
